I am a software engineer and tech lead with over a decade of experience in web development. I focus on building reliable, maintainable systems and enjoy balancing hands-on engineering with leadership responsibilities.

My work has included leading projects from concept to delivery, mentoring teammates, and improving how teams collaborate and grow. I care about clarity, ownership, and creating solutions that last.
