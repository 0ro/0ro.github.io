Greetings, I am Raman Nikitsenka, an experienced Software Engineer and Tech Lead with over 10 years of dedicated involvement in web development. My proficiency spans a range of essential technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Nest.js.

My professional journey has been marked by consistent success as a front-end developer and tech lead. I possess a robust ability to adapt to emerging challenges, and my commitment to teamwork is underscored by a strong dedication to mentoring junior colleagues.

I actively contribute to the Stack Overflow community, where I engage in collaborative problem-solving, and I derive great satisfaction from honing my skills through LeetCode challenges. Additionally, I occasionally venture into tech writing, sharing my knowledge to enrich the wider community.
